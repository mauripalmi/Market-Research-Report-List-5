<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anticorrosive Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-borne Coating</li><li>Water-borne Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anticorrosive coating market features two primary types: solvent-borne coatings and water-borne coatings. Solvent-borne coatings utilize organic solvents to dissolve the binder and provide high-performance protection against corrosion, often offering better adhesion and durability. Conversely, water-borne coatings are environmentally friendly, using water as the solvent, which reduces volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While water-borne coatings have lower environmental impact, solvent-borne options are preferred in demanding industrial applications due to their resilience and strength against harsh conditions.</p></p>
