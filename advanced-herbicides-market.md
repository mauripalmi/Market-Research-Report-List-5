<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Advanced Herbicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Translocated Herbicides</li><li>Contact Herbicides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The advanced herbicides market is primarily categorized into translocated and contact herbicides. Translocated herbicides are absorbed by plant tissues and transported throughout the plant, effectively targeting deep-rooted or stubborn weeds. In contrast, contact herbicides act directly on the plant's surface, destroying only the parts they touch. Both types serve specific agricultural needs, with translocated herbicides offering systemic control for perennial weeds, while contact herbicides provide quick, targeted solutions for annual weeds, enhancing crop management strategies.</p></p>
