<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trim System for Boats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trim Tabs</li><li>Interceptors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The trim system for boats primarily includes trim tabs and interceptors, both of which enhance vessel performance and stability. Trim tabs are adjustable devices mounted on the transom that allow the operator to alter the boat's angle in the water, improving lift and fuel efficiency. Interceptors, on the other hand, are fixed or variable-angle surfaces that provide similar benefits by changing the flow of water around the hull, optimizing handling and reducing drag. Both systems improve overall navigation dynamics.</p></p>
