<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilator circuits market comprises three main types: open, semi-open, and closed systems. Open systems allow for free exchange of gases and are typically used for patient monitoring and short-term ventilation. Semi-open systems provide a balance, allowing for limited gas exchange while offering some infection control. Closed systems, on the other hand, are designed to minimize contamination, featuring sealed components that allow for continuous mechanical ventilation, improving patient safety and comfort during extended use.</p></p>
