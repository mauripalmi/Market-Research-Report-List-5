<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cochlear Implant (CI) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unilateral Cochlear Implant</li><li>Binaural Cochlear Implant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cochlear Implant (CI) System market is primarily divided into two types: unilateral and binaural cochlear implants. Unilateral cochlear implants are designed for individuals with hearing loss in one ear, providing auditory input to that ear, enhancing speech perception and the ability to localize sounds. In contrast, binaural cochlear implants involve implanting devices in both ears, offering improved sound quality, spatial awareness, and overall hearing experience, thereby significantly benefiting patients with bilateral hearing loss.</p></p>
