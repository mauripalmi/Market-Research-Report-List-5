<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Brake Calipers</li><li>Fixed Brake Calipers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake calipers market consists primarily of two types: floating and fixed brake calipers. Floating brake calipers are mounted on brackets that allow them to move slightly, thus accommodating uneven wear on brake pads and providing effective braking performance. In contrast, fixed brake calipers are stationary, featuring pistons on either side of the rotor, which delivers more consistent braking force. Both types play crucial roles in vehicle safety and performance, catering to various automotive applications and preferences.</p></p>
