<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wax Filled PC Strand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanized Wire PC Strand</li><li>Uncoated Wire PC Strand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wax-filled PC strand market features two main types: galvanized wire PC strand and uncoated wire PC strand. Galvanized wire PC strand is coated with a zinc layer for enhanced corrosion resistance, making it suitable for outdoor and harsh environments. Uncoated wire PC strand, on the other hand, lacks this protective layer, typically used in applications where exposure to corrosive elements is minimal. Both types are integral in providing strength and durability in construction and infrastructure projects, while the wax filling offers additional protection against corrosion.</p></p>
