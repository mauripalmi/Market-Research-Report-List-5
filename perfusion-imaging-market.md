<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perfusion Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Computed Tomography (CT Scan)</li><li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</li><li>Nuclear Medicine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Perfusion imaging in medical diagnostics includes computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine techniques. CT scans involve taking multiple X-ray images from different angles to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body's tissues and organs. MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's internal structures. Nuclear medicine involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the body, which is then detected by a scanner to create images showing blood flow and tissue function.</p></p>
