<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Produced by HEU</li><li>Produced by LEU</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is a critical radioisotope used in medical imaging. The market is divided into two main types based on production methods: High-Enriched Uranium (HEU) and Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU). HEU-based Mo-99 production involves utilizing uranium enriched to higher levels, which poses proliferation concerns. In contrast, LEU-based production uses uranium with lower enrichment, aligning with non-proliferation objectives and reducing associated risks. The shift towards LEU is driven by global efforts to ensure safer, more sustainable isotope supply chains for nuclear medicine.</p></p>
