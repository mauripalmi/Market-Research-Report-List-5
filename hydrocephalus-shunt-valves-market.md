<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocephalus Shunt Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Pressure</li><li>Monopressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrocephalus shunt valves market features two primary types: adjustable pressure valves and monopressure valves. Adjustable pressure valves allow healthcare professionals to modify the pressure setting post-implantation, accommodating varying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in patients. This adaptability can enhance patient comfort and reduce complications. In contrast, monopressure valves maintain a fixed pressure level, offering simplicity and reliability but less flexibility. Both types aim to effectively manage hydrocephalus by facilitating CSF drainage, contributing to improved patient outcomes.</p></p>
