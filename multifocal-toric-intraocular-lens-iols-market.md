<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifocal toric intraocular lens (IOL) market is segmented into two main types: pre-loaded IOLs and non-pre-loaded IOLs. </p><p>Non-pre-loaded IOLs require manual loading into the delivery system before implantation, offering surgeons greater flexibility but demanding more preparation time. Conversely, pre-loaded IOLs come pre-inserted into a delivery device, streamlining the surgical process and reducing the risk of contamination. Both types aim to correct refractive errors and presbyopia while providing astigmatism correction for improved visual outcomes post-cataract surgery.</p></p>
