<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Printing with Metal Powders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DMLS</li><li>SLM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>3D printing with metal powders primarily involves two technologies: Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM). DMLS uses a laser to fuse metal powders, creating complex geometries and functional parts, often in aerospace and medical industries. SLM, on the other hand, fully melts the powder to form solid metal layers, ensuring a denser and stronger final product. Both methods enable rapid prototyping and customized manufacturing, leveraging the design freedoms inherent in additive manufacturing.</p></p>
