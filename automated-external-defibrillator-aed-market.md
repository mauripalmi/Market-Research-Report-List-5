<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) market is primarily segmented into two types: semi-automated and fully automated AEDs. Semi-automated AEDs require user intervention to deliver a shock after analyzing the patient's heart rhythm, enhancing user control during emergencies. In contrast, fully automated AEDs autonomously assess the heart's condition and administer shocks without user input, making them more user-friendly for untrained individuals. This differentiation caters to varying levels of user competence and emergency response scenarios, impacting market demand and adoption.</p></p>
