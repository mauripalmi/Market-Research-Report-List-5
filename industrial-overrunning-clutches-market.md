<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Overrunning Clutches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sprag Clutch</li><li>Spring Clutches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial overrunning clutches are essential components used to control motion and prevent reverse rotation in machinery. The sprag clutch, a common type, utilizes a series of inclined ramps and sprags to engage and disengage, allowing free movement in one direction while locking in the opposite. Spring clutches, on the other hand, rely on a spring mechanism to engage or disengage the drivetrain, providing more gradual engagement. Both types are crucial for enhancing efficiency and protecting equipment in various industrial applications.</p></p>
