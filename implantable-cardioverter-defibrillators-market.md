<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li><li>Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) market is primarily categorized into two types: transvenous ICDs and subcutaneous ICDs. Transvenous ICDs involve placing leads through veins to deliver shocks directly to the heart, providing effective treatment for arrhythmias. Subcutaneous ICDs, however, are implanted beneath the skin, offering a leadless alternative that reduces infection risk and complications. Both types cater to patients with life-threatening heart rhythms, with each design emphasizing different safety profiles, ease of implantation, and patient comfort.</p></p>
